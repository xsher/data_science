# Detecting letters from hand action recognition
The goal of the project is detect letters from hand actions and it is implemented with OpenCV.

The main code is obtained from python samples in OpenCV, camshift.py, letter_recog.py and facedetect.py

## Directory Structure
This project is carried out in 4 stages, the details of each stage is in the README of each subdirectory.
```
|- project1    # Focuses on face detection with Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV.
|- project2    # Camshift to detect hand and obtain training data
|- project3    # Training of data to obtain action recognition
|- project4    # VGG Based features for hand action recognition
```
